Your body shall be desecrated, the temple that you call your own shall be raided and conquered with no remorse.
The alleys that you call your estate will be painted red in your blood; None shall care for you, none will dare to.
Your death will be made a performance for those around. A circus act, an existence plagued by futile struggle.
Doomed, from the very start.

Do not fear for it will be slow, and dragged on. You are but a court jester, condemned to a life of performance, self-degradation and pain.
There shall be no pause nor will there be any possibility of ever reaching salvation.
Your very genetic line shall fear the act of procreation for your weak, pathetic DNA shall end here. No foul blood shall ever be spilled again.
Very well; I shall not ponder for any longer, please do hide, it makes it more fun.
